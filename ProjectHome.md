# Morphin #

Morphin is a simple video-player aiming to be similar to KDE's Dragonplayer (former Codeine). It's based on Python, Gtk+ and Gstreamer. The main focus is on usability, ergonomics and simplicity. However, it has all features that you need to watch your videos.


## Features ##
  * Simple and clean interface
  * Fast startup
  * Resume where you left off when replaying the video
  * Nice interface for selecting the last played video files
  * Video display settings (brightness, contrast, hue)
  * Video aspect settings


## Requirements ##
  * Python 2.5
  * PyGTK 2.10
  * GStreamer 0.10
  * Kiwi ([Homepage](http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi/))
  * ConfigObj ([Homepage](http://sourceforge.net/projects/configobj))


## Current Version ##
Current version is 0.0.5 Alpha4.

This release should be the last before the first beta.

I hope i can release the first beta version in the next two or three weeks.


## Installation ##
For a quick installation guide see this [site](Installation_Instructions.md).


## TODO features and Ideas ##
  * Nice [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) based overlay control for fullscreen mode
  * Nice Clutter powered 'Open Media...' interface??
